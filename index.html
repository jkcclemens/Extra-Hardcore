 Fallout: New Vegas – Extra Hardcore
</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Extra Hardcore is just a small project designed with keeping Fallout: New Vegas difficult and challenging for veteran players.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a set of custom rules that I, the author, play by. I have tried to keep the rest of this document impersonal, so it reads more like a set of rules.</p>

<p>Please keep this in mind: every rule and specification listed on this page is one that you (yes, <em>you</em>!) must enforce by yourself. That being said, you can use, ignore, modify, add to, or do whatever you want with any of these rules.</p>

<p>I have created a <a href="sheet.html">small site</a> that allows you to input your data and see various rules you need to follow. It saves your data using cookies. It really only shows your carry weight and follower eligibility, but I still find it useful.</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>Throughout this document, you will see rules listed like so:</p>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Basic rule description.</p>

<p>Elaboration and clarifications here.</p>
</div>

<p>These are important rules. If this rule is not being followed, gameplay may not continue until the rule is being abided by.</p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<ul>
<li>Enable hardcore mode.</li>
<li>Set the game to the highest difficulty.</li>
<li>Set the HUD Opacity to zero.</li>
<li>Fast traveling

<ul>
<li>One fast travel may be used per in-game day <strong>OR</strong></li>
<li>No fast traveling may be used</li>
</ul></li>
<li>VATS cannot be used.</li>
<li>During combat, the Pip-Boy cannot be accessed. It is recommended to assign hotkeys.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="carryingweight">Carrying weight</h2>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Your maximum carrying weight is determined by the following formula:</p>

<p><img class="formula" src="img/cw_formula.svg" alt="Carry weight formula"/></p>
</div>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: You must stay at or below your maximum carrying weight.</p>
</div>

<p>This formula accounts for both endurance and strength. It also factors in the current weight of all armor being worn. Some of this weight will be countered depending on how high your endurance is.</p>

<p>This formula also scales with your level to a degree. It isn&#8217;t anything game-breaking – at END 5 and STR 5, an extra pound is allowed about every three levels (very roughly).</p>

<h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>

<p>Weapons may not be too heavy, but they are usually bulky. For this reason, there are restrictions on what kinds and how many you may have. Remember that you must always stay at or below your weight limit.</p>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: The following list has the maximum amount of each type of weapon allowed:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 large melee weapon (two-handed)</li>
<li>1 small melee weapon (one-handed)</li>
<li>2 large guns (two-handed)</li>
<li>3 small guns (one-handed)</li>
<li>5 throwables</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="ammo">Ammo</h2>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: You may carry five clips/reloads for every weapon in your inventory.</p>

<p>They may be different types of ammo, but the total amount of reloads must not exceed five.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="apparel">Apparel</h2>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Anything being worn is allowed your inventory, as long as you can carry the weight.</p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: You may carry one additional piece of apparel.</p>

<p>For example, you can have a Combat Helmet, Authority Glasses, and Combat Armor, all being worn. You may have one other piece of apparel in addition to the worn items, e.g. another suit of Combat Armor or some general clothing.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="money">Money</h2>

<p>A simple table for weights is below, to help simplify the heft of each currency.</p>

<h3 id="caps">Caps</h3>

<p>Bottle caps are great. They allow us to buy things!</p>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: You take on an one two-hundredth of a pound for each cap in your inventory.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="bills">Bills</h3>

<p>NCR bills are lighter than caps and are worth more, making them a more suitable form of currency for use.</p>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: You take on one five-hundredth of a pound for each bill in your inventory.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="coins">Coins</h3>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: You take on thirteen thousandths of a pound for each coin in your inventory.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="fooddrinkmedicine">Food, drink, medicine</h2>

<p>While it&#8217;s really useful to stockpile food, drink, and medicine in your pack, there&#8217;s no way that would work in a practical situation.</p>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: You may carry a maximum two meals, two drinks, five health items, and two miscellaneous medical items at any time.</p>

<p><em>Meals</em> restore FOD. They are food.
<em>Drinks</em> restore H2O. They are liquids.
<em>Health items</em> restore HP (food/drink excluded). They are Stimpaks, Healing Powder/Poultices, etc.
<em>Medical items</em> remove negative effects like radiation or animal poison. They are RadAway, Rad-X, Snakebite Tourniquets, etc.</p>

<p>The only exception to this rule is that you may carry as much food and drink as you would like while you are at a dining establishment (including anywhere that sells food as a major function, e.g. The Atomic Wrangler).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="chems">Chems</h2>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: You may carry a maximum of five addictive chems at a time.</p>

<p>Being immune to addictions does not exempt you from this rule.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="miscellaneousitems">Miscellaneous items</h2>

<h3 id="reloadingbenchparts">Reloading bench parts</h3>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: No reloading bench parts may be carried, unless they are picked up during normal play.</p>

<p>If parts are picked up or obtained (for example, by firing rounds), they must be stored in a storage container at the next possible time for later use.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="bobbypins">Bobby pins</h3>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: You may carry a maximum of 150 bobby pins at any time.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="followers">Followers</h2>

<p>Followers are an effective way to manage storage and effectively carry more in the wastes. However, recruiting them is another story.</p>
<div class="ui yellow message">

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Followers may not be recruited unless you pass the following check:</p>

<p><img class="formula" src="img/follower_formula.svg" alt="Follower formula"/></p>

<p>This check is only necessary when asking a follower to join you; it is not necessary to keep journeying with the follower afterwards.</p>

<p>This rule is excepted by quest companions.</p>
</div>

<p>The left side of the equality is always truncated; the right side is rounded.</p>

<p>All followers&#8217; stats can be seen on the <a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_companions">wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<div class="ui blue message">

<p>Quest items that cannot be removed from your inventory do not count against you.</p>

<p>For example, the <em>Big Mountain Transportalponder!</em> does not count as a small gun, since it cannot be removed from the inventory.</p>
</div>
<div class="ui blue message">

<p>This is the style of rounding used in this set of rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the number has a decimal equal to or greater than 0.5, the number should be rounded up to the next nearest whole number.</li>
<li>If the number has a decimal less than 0.5, the number should be rounded down to the next nearest whole number.</li>
</ul>

<p>14.58 &rarr; 15
14.14 &rarr; 14</p>
</div>
<div class="ui blue message">

<p>When a number is said to be truncated, the decimal is removed.</p>

<p>14.58 &rarr; 14
14.14 &rarr; 14</p>
